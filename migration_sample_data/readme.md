## Guide to sample data

* The `article_pdfs/` directory contains four PDF files from OLA Quarterly 26(2). ([Link to issue on OJS3](https://journals3.oregondigital.org/olaq/issue/view/vol26_iss2).) The files represent a sampling of contents from different OJS "sections": two articles, a table of contents, and an introduction. 
  * __These can be used to experiment with publication workflows within OJS, including the regular submission/review workflow and the QuickSubmit plugin workflow.__
* The `ojs3_exports/` directory contains XML files for journal issues originally created in OJS3 and exported using the Native XML plugin. Content files are embedded as base64 within the XML. 
  * You should be able to use the Native XML plugin to import these XML files as full issues into another OJS 3.3 instance.
  * `ojs3_nwelearn.xml` contains two complete issues of the Northwest eLearning Journal
  * `ojs3_olaq_27-1.xml` and `ojs3_olaq_27-2.xml` each contain one complete issue of OLA Quarterly -- 27(1) and 27(2), respectively
